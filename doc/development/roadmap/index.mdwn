# Goals

- Goal: Should be able to display documents
      - Specific types to be able to display
          - [[PDF|doc/development/feature/file-format/pdf]]
          - HTML
          - EPUB
          - XPS
          - PostScript
          - [[DjVu|doc/development/feature/file-format/djvu]]
          - RTF
          - OpenDocument
          - OneNote
          - Comic book archive (.cbr)
          - Videos
- Goal: Should be able to annotate documents
      - Types of annotation targets
          - Document text (e.g., highlight text linearly or as a block)
          - Document images (e.g., highlight a region of an image)
          - Other annotations
      - Link to annotations from other documents or annotations
        - Each annotation should have a unique identifier
        - Linking can either be
          - a reference (e.g., "see figure 2 in [42]") or
          - a direct inclusion (e.g., inline display of the figure with a
            link to original document)
- Goal: Should be able to extract information from the document
      - Extraction of document structure
          - Create a table of contents automatically
      - Extraction of bibliographic metadata
        - Extract the authors and title of the current document
        - Extract the metadata from the References section
          - Allow for linking citation in the text (e.g., "in [42]" or "in
            Smith et al, 1999b") to the appropriate reference.
      - Extraction of text using optical character recognition (OCR)
      - Mathematical text should be extracted just as well as prose
      - Extraction of text in RTL writing systems should be supported (bidi
        support)
- Goal: Should be able to search and organise documents
      - Full-text search
      - Mark document as "To read", "Read", or "Do not read"
      - Tagging and folders
      - Projects and subprojects
      - Faceted search over the bibliographic metadata
      - Detect duplicates (sometimes from different sources)
          - Note that sometimes what appears to the same document by the
            title are two versions of the same document (e.g., preprint
            versus journal article)
- Goal: should be able to share data
      - Data to share
          - Documents
          - Annotations
      - Share across all of a users devices
      - Who to share with
          - People on the same LAN
          - Inside of groups (e.g., with everyone in a journal club)
- Goal: Should be able to read text out loud
      - Should be able to read mathematical text
- Goal: Notetaking
      - Pen-based notetaking
      - Handwriting recognition
      - Draw notes on top of existing document
          - Add space between lines or edges to draw more
- Goal: Security and privacy
      - Easily use Tor for all network access
      - Public and private data can live side-by-side
          - Fine-grained control (e.g., each annotation can be set to be
            public or private)
- Goal: Retrieve documents from online
      - Specs
          - Open Publication Distribution System
          - SWORD
          - OpenSearch
          - OAI-PMH
      - Download papers from sites that host papers (e.g., arXiv, PLOS)
      - Search papers from Google Scholar, PubMed
- Goal: Flexible document layout (reflowable)
      - Turn a two-column document into single column document
      - Trim extra margins
      - Look into readibility research
- Goal: Should be able to present from viewer
      - Many tools output PDFs that can be used to view slides.
      - Presentations can show different things on each screen:
          - Slides on the projector
          - Speaker notes on the monitor
- Goal: Retrieve data that is related to the document being read
      - For example, look up articles in Wikipedia/Scholarpedia or look up words in the
        dictionary.
      - Data such as properties of chemicals, 3D models of proteins, or gene
        pathways.
- Goal: Accessibility
      - Should be able to use by people with visual impairment (perhaps look at
        DAISY format, liblouis)
- Goal: Keep data on how the user is using the software
      - This can be used to give suggestions if it comes across a similar usage.
        For example, if I implemented splitting a document window into panes to
        follow, say code on one page and description of the code on another,
        when I come back to that part, it can show a little tooltip to bring
        back that same view so the user does not have to configure it again.
       - Be able to store the current view state and restore on another device.
- Goal: Have multiple user profiles that can be used simultaneously.
       - This allows for using the application for different purposes and
         keeping the data segregated.

# Project plan

- The document viewer should have typical document viewer features.
    - Navigation
        - DONE Move one page at a time.
        - DONE Move to start and end of document.
        - DONE Move to a specific page number.
    - Zooming
        - DONE Zoom to preset zoom levels.
        - TODO Zoom to a specific zoom multiplier
    - Be able to see an overview of document
        - DONE Display table of contents
        - TODO Display pages as thumbnail images
    - Be able to store the current view
