# UI

## Browser

- What are the limits to rendering in the browser?
  - number of nodes in a graph
  - fidelity of PDF rendering (for display and printing)
- Can DOM nodes be cloned by the browser engine and rendered in a new window?
    * inspired by: <http://insitu.lri.fr/metisse/>

## Desktop

# Metacognition

Discussion of metacognitive strategies that could have computer aides.

- During writing, indicators for reading level, sentiment analysis, use of
  metaphor:
    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability>
        + algorithm: readability metrics
        + possible use: prompt reader to rewrite an idea using their own
          simpler language to show they understand
    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis>
        + possible use: during conversations, use this to avoid "heated"
          language or filter out "heated" conversations. Relatedly: <http://cognitionandculture.net/blogs/hugo-mercier/why-assholes-are-more-likely-to-be-wrong/>.
    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language>
        + algorithm: etymology?
            + http://etym.org/
- Discuss phenomenon in terms of statistical distributions:
    * Make note of how frequent a phenomenon occurs. A particular
      phenomenon could be important in terms of its effects, but rare. For
      example, a [[disulfide bridge (SS bond)|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide]]
      between cysteine (Cys) amino acids is important for the stability of proteins,
      but per analysis of a *H. sapiens* proteome DB in
      [[Cysteines and Disulfide Bonds as Structure-Forming Units: Insights From Different Domains of Life and the Potential for Characterization by NMR|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7191308/]],
       Cys is found in 97% of proteins, but disulfide bonds are only marked in
       18% of proteins, but there is also another effect of protein length that is
       correlated with the presence of a disulfide bond. Further information on this:

    * Types of data
        + Spatial
            + e.g., often when discussing a phenomenon in social science, that
              phenomenon may be mistakenly either localised (only focused on a
              particular place) or universalised (assumed to exist the same way
              everywhere). It is important to know where it occurs to avoid
              parochialism.
        + Temporal
- Sourcing
    * Primary source, secondary source, etc.
        + Summaries are not the same as the primary source.
        + There have been cases where false information spreads because nobody
          looks up the original source or the author uses an invalid source:
            + the diagrams that show different locations on the tongue having
              different tastebuds
            + a journal article that cited a children's novel about Marie
              Antoinette <https://twitter.com/invitinghistory/status/1441080706344443918>,
              <https://vivelareine.tumblr.com/post/663173336356061184>
            + this thread shows step-by-step how to source historical data
              <https://twitter.com/rauchway/status/1167142811952566272>
            + there are often cases where somebody cites an article to prove a
              point, but then you follow the citation and neither the methods
              or discussion can be used to make the point that the citation makes
            + other times people cite a work without reading it. For highly
              cited works ("the classics"), this can lead to a misunderstanding of the
              intellectual history in a field, e.g., <https://twitter.com/gabriel_mathy/status/1452815294204874753>
            + <https://twitter.com/infotranecon/status/1452339829656604672>, <https://twitter.com/Scholars_Stage/status/1447744949747953669>

    * <https://thinkingpathwayz.weebly.com/thinkingroutines.html>
- Be clear about definitions
    * e.g., economic variables such as productivity can vary in definition
      based on if you are working in micro- or macro- contexts.
    * e.g., GDP is not always computed directly from national income data, but in
      some cases may be partially imputed.
    * e.g., explain how life expectancy is computed.
- Updating information
    * Some people promote an idea called "first principles" thinking (which is
      somewhat related to the idea of <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_principle> but not
      exactly), but this is better thought of as "first guess". Many things are
      more complex than using basic principles and these guesses can be wrong due to
      lack of information. To make use of this in metacognition, you need to
      look for more information after the guess, not incorporate the guess as
      the final answer.
- Sense-making
