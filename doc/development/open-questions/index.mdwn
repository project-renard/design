# UI

## Browser

- What are the limits to rendering in the browser?
  - number of nodes in a graph
  - fidelity of PDF rendering (for display and printing)
- Can DOM nodes be cloned by the browser engine and rendered in a new window?
    * inspired by: <http://insitu.lri.fr/metisse/>

## Desktop

- How difficult is it to make changes to the UI when developing on the desktop?

- How can the application be distributed on multiple platforms easily?
    * Make an installer for each platform

- How can it be integrated with a user's editor (such as Vim, Emacs, Notepad++).

# Metacognition

Discussion of metacognitive strategies that could have computer aides.

- During writing, indicators for reading level, sentiment analysis, use of
  metaphor:
    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readability>
        + algorithm: readability metrics
        + possible use: prompt reader to rewrite an idea using their own
          simpler language to show they understand
    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis>
        + possible use: during conversations, use this to avoid "heated"
          language or filter out "heated" conversations. Relatedly: <http://cognitionandculture.net/blogs/hugo-mercier/why-assholes-are-more-likely-to-be-wrong/>.
    * <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politics_and_the_English_Language>
        + algorithm: etymology?
            + http://etym.org/
- Discuss phenomenon in terms of statistical distributions:
    * Make note of how frequent a phenomenon occurs. A particular
      phenomenon could be important in terms of its effects, but rare. For
      example, a [[disulfide bridge (SS bond)|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disulfide]]
      between cysteine (Cys) amino acids is important for the stability of proteins,
      but per analysis of a *H. sapiens* proteome DB in
      [[Cysteines and Disulfide Bonds as Structure-Forming Units: Insights From Different Domains of Life and the Potential for Characterization by NMR|https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7191308/]],
       Cys is found in 97% of proteins, but disulfide bonds are only marked in
       18% of proteins, but there is also another effect of protein length that is
       correlated with the presence of a disulfide bond. Further information on this:

    * Types of data
        + Spatial
            + e.g., often when discussing a phenomenon in social science, that
              phenomenon may be mistakenly either localised (only focused on a
              particular place) or universalised (assumed to exist the same way
              everywhere). It is important to know where it occurs to avoid
              parochialism.
        + Temporal
- Sourcing
    * Primary source, secondary source, etc.
        + Summaries are not the same as the primary source.
- Thinking routines

    * <https://thinkingpathwayz.weebly.com/thinkingroutines.html>
- Be clear about definitions
    * e.g., economic variables such as productivity can vary in definition
      based on if you are working in micro- or macro- contexts.
    * e.g., GDP is not always computed directly from national income data, but in
      some cases may be partially imputed.
    * e.g., explain how life expectancy is computed.
